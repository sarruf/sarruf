Hi, I'm Eduardo Sarruf, a Computer Engineering student at PUC-Rio.

I'm currently working with Software Development at Instituto Tecgraf, mainly using C++, Qt, and Python.
I've also had some experience with Web Development (Django, Angular, TypeScript).

You can reach me by emailing sarruf *at* pm *dot* me.
