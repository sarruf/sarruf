Hi, I'm Eduardo Sarruf, a Computer Engineering student at PUC-Rio.

I'm currently working with Web Development at ECOA PUCRIO, mainly using Angular, TypeScript and PostgreSQL.
I've also had some experience with Django and Node.js at this internship.

You can reach me by emailing sarruf *at* pm *dot* me.
